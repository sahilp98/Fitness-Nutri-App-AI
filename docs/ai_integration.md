# AI Integration Planning

## AI Service Provider Integration

Our application will support both OpenAI and Google's Gemini AI to generate fitness and nutrition recommendations. This dual approach ensures service reliability and gives users options.

### Common AI Request Types

1. **Workout Plan Generation**
   - Input: User profile, fitness goals, equipment, time constraints
   - Output: Structured workout plan with exercises, sets, reps

2. **Nutrition Plan Generation**
   - Input: User profile, dietary preferences, restrictions, calorie targets
   - Output: Meal plan with recipes, nutritional information

3. **Recipe Generation**
   - Input: Available ingredients, dietary preferences, nutritional goals
   - Output: Recipe with preparation instructions and nutritional breakdown

4. **Progress Analysis**
   - Input: User's historical workout and nutrition data, current measurements
   - Output: Analysis and recommendations for adjustments

### AI Prompt Templates

#### Workout Plan Generation Prompt
```
Generate a [DURATION]-week workout plan for a [AGE] year old [GENDER] with the following details:
- Height: [HEIGHT] cm, Weight: [WEIGHT] kg
- Activity level: [ACTIVITY_LEVEL]
- Fitness goals: [FITNESS_GOALS]
- Available equipment: [EQUIPMENT]
- Time available per session: [TIME_AVAILABLE] minutes
- Workout frequency: [FREQUENCY] days per week
- Any limitations or injuries: [LIMITATIONS]

Please format the workout plan as a detailed weekly schedule with specific exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods. Include warm-up and cool-down recommendations.
```

#### Nutrition Plan Generation Prompt
```
Create a daily meal plan for a [AGE] year old [GENDER] with the following details:
- Height: [HEIGHT] cm, Weight: [WEIGHT] kg
- Activity level: [ACTIVITY_LEVEL]
- Fitness goals: [FITNESS_GOALS]
- Daily calorie target: [CALORIES] calories
- Macronutrient breakdown: [PROTEIN]g protein, [CARBS]g carbohydrates, [FATS]g fats
- Dietary preferences: [PREFERENCES]
- Food allergies or restrictions: [RESTRICTIONS]
- Number of meals per day: [MEALS_COUNT]

Please provide specific meal suggestions with portion sizes, calorie counts, and macronutrient breakdowns. Include simple recipes or preparation instructions where appropriate.
```

### AI Response Processing

Both AI providers will return structured text that needs to be parsed. We'll implement parsers to:

1. Extract structured data from AI responses
2. Validate data for completeness and accuracy
3. Format data to match our application's data models
4. Handle edge cases where the AI response doesn't match expected format

### Error Handling

1. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. Fallback strategy: If primary AI provider fails, try secondary provider
3. Cache common requests to reduce API calls
4. Pre-defined templates for common scenarios to use when AI services are unavailable
